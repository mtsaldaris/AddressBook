# AddressBook Coding Challenge

This repository contains the code for the Address Book Coding Challenge. Î¤he application implemented an Address Book that allows
a user to store (between successive runs of the program) the name and phone numbers of their friends, with the following functionality:
- To enter a friends name and phone number using a form with input validation
- To display the list of friends and their corresponding phone numbers sorted by their name.
- Given another address book that may or may not contain the same friends, display the list of friends that are unique to each address book (the union of all the relative complements).
