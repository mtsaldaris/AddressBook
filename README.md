# AddressBook Coding Challenge

This repository contains the code for the Address Book Coding Challenge. Î¤he application implemented an Address Book that allows
a user to store (between successive runs of the program) the name and phone numbers of their friends, with the following functionality:
- To enter a friends name and phone number using a form with input validation (backend).
- To display the list of friends and their corresponding phone numbers sorted by their name.

# Architecture & Usage

### Database - PostgreSQL

A PostgreSQL database is used for this application."AddressBook" table is initialised from "Contant" entity in Spring Boot backend. Databse is then seeded with 7 initial contacts. In order to connect to the database PostgreSQL server must be running on port 542.
Database configuration can be changed in file: `address-book\src\main\resources\application.properties`

Compulsary changes to connect to db:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/[DATABASE_NAME]
spring.datasource.username=[USERNAME]
spring.datasource.password=[PASSWORD]
```

### Backend - Java (Spring Boot) 

The backend for this application was implemented using Spring Boot. A layered architecture was used based around the "Contact" Model.
To start the back end, first run `mvn install` then `mvn spring-boot:run` or `java -jar target/address-book-0.0.1.jar` to start the dev server on port 8080.

#### REST API ENDPOINTS:

##### GET: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/contact/getAll`
- Get all contacts from database

##### GET: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/contact/getUniqueContacts`
- Get unique contacts - not implemented due to time constraints

##### POST: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/contact/add`
- Add a new Contact to database 

##### Payload:
```
{
	"firstName": "Fred",
	"lastName": "Jones",
	"phoneNumber":  "0412345678" 
}
```

### Frontend- React

The frontend was developed using ReactJS. It features a single page view for the Address Book with a UI component to display all contacts.
There is a button which displays a modal with a form to add a new contact. The onSubmit function of the form catches any errors from the backend validation and displays them on the form. The form will not submit unless there is valid input.

To deploy the front end, first run `npm install` to install dependencies then `npm start` to start the dev server on port 3000.
